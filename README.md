**PyTorch** is an open-source deep learning framework widely used for building and training neural networks. It provides a flexible platform for developing AI applications, offering dynamic computation graphs, GPU acceleration, and an intuitive Pythonic interface. Researchers and developers prefer PyTorch because it allows rapid prototyping, debugging, and deployment of complex machine learning models with ease, making it one of the most popular frameworks in both academia and industry.  

**TorchVision** is a companion library to PyTorch that focuses on computer vision tasks. It includes utilities for handling image and video datasets, performing data transformations, and accessing pre-trained models for tasks like classification, detection, and segmentation. With TorchVision, developers can streamline their workflow by reusing existing vision models and datasets, which speeds up experimentation and reduces the need for building everything from scratch.  

On the Jetson Nano, combining PyTorch with TorchVision is especially beneficial because it enables efficient **edge AI development**. The Nano is a compact, low-power GPU device designed for real-time AI inference. With PyTorch and TorchVision installed, developers can run state-of-the-art vision models locally on the device without depending on cloud servers. This setup allows applications such as object detection, surveillance, robotics, and assistive technologies to work in real time, directly on embedded hardware, making the Jetson Nano a powerful and affordable platform for AI at the edge.
